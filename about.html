        <p>
          My coding journey began with Lynda where I studied HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript. I've also used freeCodeCamp, General Assembly, CodeAcademy, and LeetCode for
          practice. Today, studying software development has built character and
          helped me push past my limits. Continuing on, software engineering has pushed me
          from my comfort zone in several ways. Learning software engineering has improved my critical
          thinking has taught me to use more abstract reasoning to look at
          concepts from a broad perspective. It has also helped me become
          comfortable with mistakes. I am learning so mistakes are my friends
          and teachers. Prioritizing understanding and first-hand experience, I
          no longer fear making a mistake.
