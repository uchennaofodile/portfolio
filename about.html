          My coding journey has been nothing short of a whirlwind. Coming from
          humble beiginnings, I began learning to code by studying web
          development on Lynda as I studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript and
          programming fundamentals. From there, I went on to enroll in a web
          development bootcamp offered at my local Career Source where I
          continued to hone my skills in web development tacking on a couple of
          projects along the way. After graduating from the program, I landed my
          dream role at IBM as an application developer apprentice; however,
          after that things began to take a turn for the worse. I started to
          develop some unexplained health issues, ended up being hospitalized
          and was forced to leave the apprenticeship.

          Left hopeless by the medical community, I had a choice: give up or
          fight. I chose to fight and after healing myself holistically through
          diet and lifestyle changes, I am healthier than I have ever been. But
          my journey is not about just me. My determination and tenacity brought
          me to where I am today, but I cannot forget the role my family has
          played in my life and how my experiences shaped me into who I am
          today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Studying software development has built character and helped me push
          past my limits literally and figuratively. Learning software
          engineering has improved my critical thinking has taught me to use
          more abstract reasoning to look at concepts from a broad perspective.
          The path to software engineering is paved with many roads in the sand,
          all equally valid with some quicker, some seemingly elusive and
          unattainable, yet despite the unending paths one can take the constant
          is my unyielding desire to accomplish what I have set out to do. Let's
          create.
